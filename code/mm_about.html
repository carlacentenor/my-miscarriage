    <h5 class="defintion-title">"If you don't mention it yourself, nobody talks about miscarriage. Now that I have told
      friends and family,
      many have been through the same thing; but it is not something we talk openly about?"</h5>

  <div class="about-wrapper">
    <p>By talking about our miscarriages, we can break the taboo, share experiences to support and help someone going
      through it.
      There is scarce information covering what one could experience before, during, and after a miscarriage.
      Could it hurt? For how long could I bleed? Could the period change afterward? Etc.
    </p>

    <p>MM is a platform where anonymous testimonies are shared. These have been collected from open social media
      platforms or shared.
      Have you had a miscarriage? You are far from alone ❤️ Please share your experience and break the silence
      culture!
    </p>

    <p><span class="bold">The page does not distinguish between</span> miscarriages/missed abortions/missed miscarriage/
      and, or silent
      miscarriage.
      However, at the moment it does not include testimonies of stillbirths (20th week of pregnancy).
