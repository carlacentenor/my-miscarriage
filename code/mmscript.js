// so this is how to make a coment!

/* between these 
are 
commenting out like # in python
*/
var a = "Hello ", b = "world", c = " wtf";

// this makes it happen by default in consol
console.log(a+b+c);

// DOCUMENT - what makes it visibile for the user
// document.write();


// objects gives the possibility to store multiple values within one varible. It's like a dictonary {}

// Maybe the JS can be used to update the page with info when published? and the graphs? Mayve not??
