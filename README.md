# my-miscarriage
MM is a personal project created to share testimonies of experienced miscarriages.

## Why?
There is very little information that could help a menstruator prepare or just feel less alone. Since roughly 15 - 20% of all pregnancies ends with a miscarriage. According to UNICEF, every minute 258 babies are born - I leave it to you to estimate how many menstruators who had to go through a misscarriage. 

## Webpage 
At the moment MM is having its skeleton created. The code is all over the place, but will be cleaned, modified and more effective as time passes. 

## Want to contribute?
Please feel free to contribute, all help is wanted and all sharing of knowledge (within and spreading the projects future content) is appreciated.
